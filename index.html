<h2>HTML</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The head element contains information about the webpage </li>
  <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
  <li>Elements nestled inside other elements are called child elements</li>
  <li>The elements that hold all the "children" are known as the parent element</li>
  <li>HTML builds the frame, CSS defines the style, and JavaScript makes it interactive </li>
  <li>HTML attributes are always defined in the beginning element never the closing element</li>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
  <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
  <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
  <li>Inline CSS: quick and permanent not as flexible as others, requires each inline style individually edited</li>
  <li>Internal style sheet unlike inline can embed entire stylesheet directly into HTML </li>
  <li>External CSS style sheet us most common allows CSS rules to be kept in separate file, changes are easier</li>
</ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
<h2>Git</h2>
<ul>
  <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
  <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it </li>
  <li>git branch: to see local branches</li>
  <li>git log: show all commits in current branches history</li>
  <li>Pull Requests (PR): way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged to another, others can see discuss and review</li>
  <li>A branch is a copy/version of code that can be worked on independently in isolation</li>

</ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<ul>
  <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
  <li>To declare a variable use the var keywork, after that give the variable a unique name, than use = to assign data we are storing in it</li>
  <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
  <li>A for loop or conditional statement automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run</li>
  <li>A function does not automatically run, you must call a function by name to execute it</li>
  <li>Boolean: True/False value, these are special keywords and don't need quoote marks</li>
  <li>Array: structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
  <li>(===): Checks to see if two values are equal and returns a boolean result true if values are equal and false if they are not equal</li>
