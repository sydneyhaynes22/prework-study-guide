# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created for boot camp students going through prework. It contains notes on HTML,CSS, Git, and Javascript. This webpage terves  a dual purpose. It works as a study guide for the information learned during prework, and it provides an opportunity to learn the necessary skills to complete a full-stack web application. The motivating factor behind this project was to gain experince and confidence when it came to the fundamental concepts of web development. This project solves two problems. The first problem it solves is a central location for the large amount of information that is covered during prework. The second problem it solves is providing a warmup in this course to learn introductory coding skills. From this project I learned how to get into the mindset of a developer, build a simple web application, and the importance of persistance when coming across a coding problem.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide Webpage contains four sections with notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. The topics are separated for easy navigation and within each topic the information is organized into bullet points for a concise read. If you need a suggestion on what study first open the DevTools console by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). The console should open up on the bottom or side of your web browser. In the console you'll see the JavaScript running, a list of the topics learned in prework, and a suggestion on what to study first on the last line.
